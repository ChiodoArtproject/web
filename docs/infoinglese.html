Stefano Chiodini
</h1>
<p>
Artisan specialized in glass, a passion that represents the heart of my work.
I was born and raised in the province of Milan, but I have been living in Andalusia, in Granada, for 8 years, where I have found love, inspiration, and the masters who have significantly enriched my creative journey.
</p>
<p>
I founded "Chiodo Art Project", through which I explore the techniques of "Tiffany", stained glass, and "Industrial Art".
</p>
<p>
Among my achievements, I was a finalist in the "Milano Vetro Under 35" competition, with a piece exhibited at the "Castello Sforzesco" in Milan.
</p>
<p>
I obtained a diploma in "Industrial Mechanical Technician" and have participated in specialization courses at important institutions:
</p>
<p>
"The magic of fire and application of color on glass" at the "Centro Albaizyn de Granada" and the course "Historic Stained Glass: study, cataloging, and conservation" at the "Escuela del Patrimonio de NÃ¡jera". (Where I became a member of ARCOVE)
</p>
<p>
In addition to my art, I am an avid cyclist and have obtained the certificate of "Mountain Bike and Cycle Tourism instructor". In 2021, I embarked on an extraordinary adventure by crossing Spain by bicycle.
</p>
<p>
Writing is also one of my passions: I enjoy composing "irreverent sonnets" that express my creativity.
</p>
<p>
Currently, I am dedicated to creating this webpage, using only "HTML" language and codes, to reflect my passion and the authenticity of my work.
</p>

I invite you to discover my creations and immerse yourself in my artistic world!
